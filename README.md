# Chronos Agent

Reference implementation of an agent library written in Java. This library handles all the communication with [Chronos Control](https://github.com/Chronos-EaaS/Chronos-Control) including the upload of the results. It provides an interface with all necessary methods required for adding Chronos support to an existing evaluation client.
